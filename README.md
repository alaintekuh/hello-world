# hello-world
I am interested in becoming a DevOps engineer
i currently don't have any knowledge on programming but i intend to make DevOps my main stay because i suddenly have developed a love for software engineering.
i am currently constraint because i don't have enough resources to pay for my full training but i am trusting the process such that before the due date to pay my tuition i would acquired the fee.

i really don't know for sure how long it will take me to study and understand this course but i am optimistic it'll be a great experience for me.

i studied computing to be able to do small normal day activities but this experience is taking me to a whole new level.
